**Note**: Ensure that you are viewing MarkUs as an admin and have not switched roles. Otherwise, you will be unable to access the "Administration" tab.

## Managing Users

As with courses, to manage users, navigate to the "Users" sub tab on the MarkUs Administration Page

This will redirect you to a page where you can specify the following user information:

- **User Name**: The username alias for this user.
- **First Name**: This user's first name.
- **Last Name**: This user's last name.
- **ID Number**: This user's id number. This can be blank if it is not applicable to a user.
- **Email**: This user's email address. This can be blank if it is not applicable to a user.
- **Type**: A user can either be an "Admin User" or an "End User". In most cases, you will likely want to create an "End User". "End Users" are regular users who can later be specified as an "Instructor", "TA", or "Student" for a particular course. "Admin Users" have the ability to manage MarkUs and view all courses as if they were instructors. Be sure to only give an Admin User account to trusted users. 

After clicking "Save", the user will be created and you will be taken back to the list of all users.

If you later wish to modify any properties of a user you can reach a user's edit page by navigating to the list of all users on the MarkUs Administration Page and clicking on the "edit" action of the user you wish to modify.

From the edit page of a user you can modify the same properties specified when creating a user.
