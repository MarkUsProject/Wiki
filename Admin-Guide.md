## Managing Courses

In order to create a course, click on the "Create Course" link located at the top right corner of the page.

This will redirect you to a page where you can specify the following course properties:

- **Name**: The name or course code for this course
- **Display Name**: A longer course name or title for users to see
- **Course Visibility**: Selecting "hidden" will hide the course from students in a course. Graders and instructors for the course can still see and manage the course as usual.

After clicking "Save", the course will be created and you will be taken back to the list of all courses.

If you later wish to modify any properties of a course you can reach any course's edit page by going to the list of all courses and clicking on the "edit" action of the course you wish to modify.
