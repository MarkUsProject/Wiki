# Course Settings

The course settings page provides information on the name, display name and course visibility properties of a course.

While you cannot change the name or display name for a course, you are free to toggle it's visibility. Setting a course as "hidden" hides the course from all users regardless of whether they are enrolled in the course or not. Instructors for the course will still be able to see and modify a hidden course. Setting a course as "visible" allows all users registered in the course to access the course as usual.
