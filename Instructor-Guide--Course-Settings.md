# Course Settings

The course settings page provides information on the name, display name and course visibility properties of a course.

While you cannot change the name or display name for a course, you are free to toggle its visibility. Setting a course as "hidden" hides the course from all students. To unhide a course from students, you may do so by setting the course as "visible". Instructors and graders will still have access to a course regardless of its visibility.
