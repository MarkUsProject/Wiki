## Summary Tab

The summary tab can be used to view/visualize a variety of general statistics for a particular assignment. In addition, you may also view a summary of the grade breakdown for each submission. These are highlighted below.

### Summary Table

After visiting the summary tab, you will first see the summary table. This table gives a summarized grade breakdown for each student/submission. Each row in the table corresponds to a particular submission group. For each row you can view the name of the submission group, its marking state, any tags the submission may have, a total mark for the submission, and finally a mark breakdown of the submission from associated criteria.

If you wish to download this table for offline use in a CSV format, select the "Download" button in the top right. Alternatively, if you ran tests on submissions and wish to download the results of those tests, you can click the "Download Test Results" button also found in the top right.

### Summary Statistics

Clicking on the "Summary Statistics" tab in the top left corner of the summary page will take you to the summary statistics view. This view allows you to easily visualize and look at key statistics that summarizes overall student performance on the given assignment. This is an enlarged view of the summary statistics you can find on the dashboard.

In the top left section, you can see a chart that displays the distribution of grades for the given assignment.

To the right of the grade distribution chart is a set of statistics that give a brief overview of student performance on the given assignment. Statistics that are currently shown are:

![Assignment Summary Overview](images/summary-stats-overview.png)

- **Number of groups:** The number of groups created for this assignment. This is also the expected total number of submissions (assuming all groups have a submission).
- **Number of students in a group:** The number of students that are in a group out of all active students in the course.
- **Number of submissions collected:** The number of submissions that have been collected for marking out of the expected total number of submissions.
- **Number of submissions graded:** The number of submissions that have been collected and have recieved a mark out of the expected total number of submissions.
- **Average:** The average point grade of submissions for the given assignment (including submissions which recieved a zero) out of the maximum possible mark.
- **Median:** The median grade of submissions for the given assignment (including submissions which recieved a zero) out of the maximum possible mark.
- **Standard deviation:** The point grade standard deviation of submissions for the given assignment (including submissions which recieved a zero). In brackets next to this statistic is the standard deviation of submissions given as a percentage grade.
- **Number of fails:** How many graded submissions recieved a failing grade (i.e. recieved a grade under 50%) out of the expected total number of submissions.
- **Number of zeros:** How many graded submissions recieved a grade of zero out of the expected total number of submissions.
- **Remark requests completed:** How many remark requests have been completed out of the total number of remark requests recieved. This statistic will only show if you have enabled remark requests for the given assignment.

> :spiral_notepad: **Note:** In brackets, next to each of the statistics that are shown as a fraction, is the same statistic fraction but displayed as a percentage instead.

Finally, at the bottom of the view, below the grade distribution chart, you can see another distribution of grades for an assignment. What differentiates this grade distribution graph from the one above however, is that each bar from the graph above is broken up in order to also show the distribution of marks given by each grader.

Each grader corresponds to a colour shown in the labels just above the graph. Each label also shows how many submissions each grader has completed marking out of the number they were assigned.

To view a more discrete breakdown of each grader shown in the grader distribution graph, click on the "Graders" link in the bottom left corner of the grader distribution graph.

This will take you to a page that shows several individual graphs showing the distribution of marks given by each grader.
