## Summary Tab

The summary tab can be used to view/visualize a variety of general statistics for a particular assignment. In addition, you may also view a summary of the grade breakdown for each submission. These are highlighted below.

### Summary Statistics

As soon as you visit the summary tab, you will first see a page that displays key statistics which summarize overall student performance for a particular assignment.

On the top of a page are a set of statistics that summarize the performance of an assignment. Statistics that are currently shown are:

- **Average:** The average grade of submissions for an assignment (including those which recieved a zero)
- **Median:** The median grade of submissions for an assignment (including those which recieved a zero)
- **Number of Fails:** How many submissions recieved a failing grade (i.e. recieved a grade under 50%)
- **Number of Zeros:** How many submissions recieved a grade of zero
- **Number of Submissions Collected:** The number of submissions that have been collected for marking
- **Number of Submissions Graded:** The number of submissions that have been collected and have recieved a mark

Above the number of fails, zeros, submissions collected, and submissions graded, you can also view as a percentage how large each particular group of submissions are in comparison to the total number of submissions.

Below these statistics, you can also see a chart that displays the distribution of marks for the entire assignment.

At the bottom of the page, you can still see a distribution of marks for an assignment however, each bar from the assignment graph above is further broken up to show the distribution of marks given from each grader.

Each grader corresponds to a colour shown in the labels just above the graph. The labels also show how many submissions each grader has completed marking out of the number they are assigned.

To view a more discrete breakdown of each grader shown in the grader distribution graph, click on the "Graders" link in the top right corner of the grader distribution graph.

This will take you to a page that shows an individual graph showing the distribution of marks for each grader.
