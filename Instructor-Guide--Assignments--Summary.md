## Summary Tab

The summary tab can be used to view/visualize a variety of general statistics for a particular assignment. In addition, you may also view a summary of the grade breakdown for each submission. These are highlighted below.

### Summary Table

As soon as you visit the summary tab, you will first see a page containing a table that summarizes the grade breakdown for each student. Each row in the table corresponds to a particular submission group. For each row you can view the name of the submission group, its marking state, any tags the submission may have, a total mark for the submission, and finally a mark breakdown of the submission from associated criteria.

If you wish to download this table, you can select the "Download" button in the top right. Alternatively, if you ran tests on submissions and wish to download the results of those tests, you click the "Download Test Results" button also found in the top right.

### Summary Statistics

Clicking on the "Summary Statistics" tab in the top left corner of the summary page will allow you to view key statistics which summarize overall student performance for a particular assignment. This is an enlarged view of the summary statistics you can find on the dashboard.

In the top left of the page, you can see a chart that displays the distribution of grades for the given assignment.

To the right of the grade distribution chart is a set of statistics that summarizes overall student performance on an assignment. Statistics that are currently shown are:

- **Average:** The average grade of submissions for an assignment (including submissions which recieved a zero)
- **Median:** The median grade of submissions for an assignment (including submissions which recieved a zero)
- **Number of Fails:** How many submissions recieved a failing grade (i.e. recieved a grade under 50%)
- **Number of Zeros:** How many submissions recieved a grade of zero
- **Number of Submissions Collected:** The number of submissions that have been collected for marking
- **Number of Submissions Graded:** The number of submissions that have been collected and have recieved a mark

At the bottom of the page, below the grade distribution chart, you can still see a distribution of grades for an assignment however, each bar from the assignment graph above is further broken up to show the distribution of marks given by each grader.

Each grader corresponds to a colour shown in the labels just above the graph. The labels also show how many submissions each grader has completed marking out of the number they are assigned.

To view a more discrete breakdown of each grader shown in the grader distribution graph, click on the "Graders" link in the bottom left corner of the grader distribution graph.
