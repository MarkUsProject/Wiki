# Managing Groups

On this page, you will find useful information about how to manage your assignment or project groups on MarkUs.

## Creating a group

Context: two students, Alice and Bob, are working together in a group for assignment "A1".
On MarkUs, they must *declare their group* by doing the following.

1. (Alice) Log into MarkUs, and click on the "A1" link under **Your Assignments**
2. (Alice) In the **Group Information** pane on the right, click on the `Create` button.
3. (Alice) After the page refreshes, click on the `Invite` button. Enter the Bob's username and press `Submit`.

    **Warning**: At this point, Bob has been *invited* to the group, but that doesn't mean Bob is in the group!
    Even if Alice submits work, only she will get a mark; Bob won't if he hasn't accepted the invitation.
4. (Bob) Log into MarkUs, and click on the "A1" link.
5. (Bob) Click on the `Join` button underneath Alice's invitation.

At this point, the group has been declared, and both partners may begin submitting files.

**Only one group member should create a group by pressing the `Create` button.**
Even if your group has three or more people, one group member is responsible for creating the group and inviting all other group members.
