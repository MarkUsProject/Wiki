## Testing with RSpec

Testing with RSpec involves specifications (files containing tests), and examples within these specifications (the actual tests). In order to get the most out of this tutorial, it is recommended that you follow along in the `spec` folder, which is located in the Markus root folder.

**Note**: [Better Specs](http://betterspecs.org/) is another resource that illustrates best practices using RSpec (you will notice most of our style uses their suggestions). Refer to this guide for anything not explicitly covered here. It is also a great resource for more examples on most of what *is* covered.

## How to Run Specifications

**Note:** The following commands assume you are within the Markus root folder. If you running MarkUs with Docker, you must be in a shell in the [rails Docker container](Developer-Guide--Set-Up-With-Docker.md#running-commands-in-docker).

To run all specifications:

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

To run a specific specification:

```sh
bundle exec rspec <file-path>
```

For example, to run the group model specification, run `bundle exec rspec spec/models/group_spec.rb`.

## Naming Conventions

### Folders

The name of the folder which holds the specifications should have the same name as the folder storing the files being tested. For example, model files are stored in the folder `app/models`, so model specifications are stored in `spec/models`.

### Files

The name of the specification for the file being tested is the name of the file followed by `'_spec'`. For example, the group model file is named `group.rb`, so the group model specification will be `group_spec.rb`.

## Helper Gems

### FactoryBot

FactoryBot is used to create instances of Models for testing. A great introduction to FactoryBot can be found [here](https://rubydoc.info/gems/factory_bot/file/GETTING_STARTED.md).

Within the `spec` folder (found in the Markus root folder), you will find a folder called `factories`. This is where all current factories being used for testing are stored. The filename of each factory should be the plural form of the filename of the Model it refers to (because there are multiple factories of the same kind in one file). For example, the `Group` Model is contained in a file called `group.rb` and so the factory filename is `groups.rb`. Another example would be a model filename of `criterion.rb` and a factory filename of `criteria.rb`.

Look through a few of them to get a sense of what the template looks like. Each factory corresponds to one of Markus's Models.

FactoryBot's `create` method is used to make and save instances of Models. The `create` method should only be used when absolutely necessary. It creates instances that will persist within the database making it a culprit to extremely slow tests. It may be difficult to avoid using them in Model specifications because you are testing interactions with the database (Active Record queries).

Not using `create` means using `build_stubbed`, another Factory Girl method that makes a mock object (meaning an object that does not persist in the database). We will go into more detail about mock objects in the [Controller Specifications](#controller-specifications) section.

As an example, say we want to create a `Group` instance that will persist within the database, we would use `create`:

```ruby
@group = create(:group)
```

If the instance does not need to persist within the database we use `build_stubbed`:

```ruby
@group = build_stubbed(:group)
```

It is also possible to explicitly assign a value to attributes of the object you are creating. A `Group` instance has an attribute `group_name` and we'd like to make sure it has the value 'g2markus'. This is done like so:

```ruby
@group = create(:group, group_name: 'g2markus')
```

### Faker

While exploring the files within the factories folder you probably noticed the Faker gem being used. We use Faker alongside Factory Girl to easily create fake data. Faker calls are placed within curly braces to ensure when an instance is created using Factory Girl it has unique values for its attributes. Types of data available to fake can be found [here](https://github.com/stympy/faker).

## Model Specifications

Open the `models` folder within the `spec` folder, and explore the files. All model specifications have the following template:

```ruby
describe ModelName do
  attribute_examples
  method_examples
end
```

We will explore the code that would replace `attribute_examples`, and `method_examples` above. Code from the `group_spec.rb` file, which tests the `Group` model, will be used as reference throughout the Model specification section of the guide. Open that file, and look through it as you follow along below.

### Attribute Examples

The first set of examples in our model specification will be for the Model’s attributes. Shoulda-matchers are used to test common rails attribute validators. It makes for simple, elegant one-liners.

For example, recall the model `Group` has an attribute `group_name`. This attribute must be present in order for a group to be successfully created. Now look in the `group_spec.rb`, and notice the first example is testing that requirement:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:group_name) }
```

We use shoulda-matchers because the examples are easily understood just by reading them. As seen in the file, there are other matchers available to test for uniqueness, length, etc. More available shoulda-matchers can be found [here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers).

### Method Examples

As you have probably noticed in the `group_spec.rb` file, all method examples are written within their own `describe` block. If the method is an instance method, the description of the block will be a hash followed by the method’s name:

```ruby
describe '#method_name' do
  method_example
end
```

If the method is a class method, the description of the block will be a dot followed by the method name:

```ruby
describe '.method_name' do
  method_example
end
```

The example for this method will be contained within the block, replacing `method_example`. Most examples will need instances of Model's to run. There are various ways instances can be initialized. One is within a before block:

```ruby
before :each do
  @group = create(:group, group_name: 'g2markus')
end
```

The code within the before block will be executed before every example. Before blocks should only be used if there is something other than initializing variables that needs to be done before each test.

Another way to Initialize instances is by using `let`, or `let!`. This is the preferred method. `let` and `let!` allow for lazy and eager evaluation of an instance, respectively:

```ruby
# This will evaluate the instance when `group` is first called in the example.
let(:group) { create(:group, group_name: 'g2markus') }

# This will evaluate before the example is executed.
let!(:group) { create(:group, group_name: 'g2markus') }
```

The initialization can be placed in various places depending on need. If all methods will need the instance, it would make sense to place it at the beginning of the Model's `describe` block. If only a certain method needs it, place it at the beginning of that method's `describe` block (this would also work for other types of blocks described below).

You almost certainly want to wrap initialization code in either `let` or `before` as it guarantees they are run before each enclosed example is run. If your initialization is outside of `let` and `before`, then they will only be (eagerly) evaluated once before the enclosed examples capture the variables in the closures of their blocks. This is often undesired in unit testing.

All examples should be contained within `it` blocks, all of which must be accompanied by a description written in third person present tense ([avoid the use of "should" in the description](http://betterspecs.org/#should)):

```ruby
it 'does ...' do
it 'is ...'
```

Each example is limited to one expectation. Bad:

```ruby
it 'does ...' do
  expect(something).to be_something
  expect(another_thing).to be_another_thing
end
```

Good:

```ruby
it 'does ...' do
  expect(something).to be_something
end

it 'does ...' do
  expect(another_thing).to be_another_thing
end
```

This improves readability and ensures all aspects are tested even in the case of a failure (whereas with multiple expectations per example, later expectations won't be run if an earlier expectation fails).

For a simple example of this, within `group_spec.rb`, scroll down to the method `repository_name`. An instance is created using Factory Girl, and used within the `it` block. Looking through the different examples within the specification files is a great resource for learning how to test. A starting point for understanding how to use the `expect` syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations). A great introduction, but not free, resource is Aaron Sumnor's [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec).

As you scrolled down to `repository_name` examples, you probably noticed another set of examples testing the `set_repo_name` method. Some methods may have different states in which a different set of instructions will be executed based on the state. This is the case for the `set_repo_name` method which can be called on an instance of `Group`. When the instance was created a repository name may have been specified if it was specified that group names should be automatically generated (if it was not specified an auto generated name will be created). In these cases the `context` block is used to distinguish the different states. Context descriptions begin with `when` or `with`, and the template for this is usually:

```ruby
describe '#method_name' do
  context 'when in this state' do
    method_example
  end

  context 'when in this other state' do
    method_example
  end
end
```

You can use as many context blocks as needed to represent the possible states the method can be called in.

All methods within the model being tested, should be tested. If you feel a method should not be tested, leave a comment explaining your reasoning above the method's describe block:

```ruby
# This method is not being tested because...
describe '#method_name'
```

This will inform other developers that the method was not accidentally forgotten, but instead, just reasoned to not be tested.

## Controller Specifications

Controller specifications will have the following template:

```ruby
describe ControllerName do
  context 'some type of user' do
    method_examples
  end

  context 'some other type of user' do
    method_examples
  end
end
```

`some type of user` and `some other type of user` describing the context blocks usually correspond to someone who has authorization to perform certain tasks (usually an instructor) and someone who does not.

Code from the `groups_controller_spec.rb` file, which tests the `GroupsController` controller, will be used as reference throughout the Controller specification section of the guide. Open that file, and look through it as you follow along below.

### Method Examples

Controller methods are placed within `describe` blocks with the description as a hash followed by the method name. Before the hash, the description also has the request type the method will make.

For example, the `GroupController` has a method called `index`, which sends out a GET request, so:

```ruby
describe 'GET #index' do
  method_example
end
```

Controller testing is not concerned with states of objects, and so mocking instances is preferred (the tests are a lot faster). Also, because we would have already tested the Model methods within the Model specification, we do not need to be retesting them when they are called within a Controller method.

A stub is used to create the illusion that a method was called, returning a specified result. A mock is a stub expecting a specified method to be called. A starting point for learning to stubbing and mocking can be found [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks). If you want another resource on mocking and stubbing, check out Code School’s Testing with RSpec videos ([Level 5 is on Mocking and Stubbing](http://rspec.codeschool.com/)).

Controller specifications will have both mocks and stubs, so when do you use which? As the examples will illustrate below, you stub a method when you need to prevent it from accessing the database. And you mock a method when you need to ensure it is called.

Lets start with mocking objects (which is different than mocking methods). As seen in the [FactoryBot](#factorybot) section above we make a mock object like this:

```ruby
build_stubbed(:object)
```

If we wanted to create a mock grouping object:

```ruby
grouping = build_stubbed(:grouping)
```

Now `grouping` is a mock instance that does not persist in the database. All methods called on `grouping` that requires database access would fail. This is why we need stubs.

Open the `groups_controller_spec.rb` file (if you haven't already). Both mock grouping, and assignment objects are created at the start using `let`. The `before` block just under these mocks contains a whole bunch of stubs. The first few are to ensure we have administrative privileges. Many of the methods tested within this file call the `Assignment` model’s `find` method. This method takes an `id` belonging to an assignment and returns the assignment. To make sure this method isn’t actually executed, we stub it (remember we don’t actually have an assignment so this search will fail). This is what the stub for the `Assignment`’s `find` method looks like:

```ruby
allow(Assignment).to receive(:find).and_return(assignment)
```

The above stub will make sure when `find` is called the mocked assignment will be returned.

All Model methods called within the controller should be mocked. This is a test that ensures the methods that should be called, will be called. For example, the method `new` within the `GroupsController` calls `Assignment` model’s method `add_group`. It is called using the mock assignment we have, and returns a grouping. To make sure this method is called we create the mock, and call the controller method being tested:

```ruby
expect(assignment).to receive(:add_group).with(nil).and_return(grouping)
get :new, assignment_id: assignment
```

## System Specifications

System specifications will have the following template:

```ruby
describe Action do
  context 'some type of user' do
    action_examples
  end

  context 'some other type of user' do
    action_examples
  end
end
```

Notice that the template is similar to controller specifications. `some type of user` and `some other type of user` still generally describe context blocks that correspond to someone who has authorization to perform certain actions. The difference however, is that system tests are used to describe and test actions performed via the UI. These tests use Capybara, an acceptance test framework that simulates user interaction. For more information, documentation about Capybara can be found [here](https://rubydoc.info/github/teamcapybara/capybara/master). These simulated user interactions are run and tested on a chrome browser running on your local machine.

### Writing System Tests

System tests are written using the Capybara Design Specification Language. These tests revolve around finding elements on a given page and performing certain actions on that element; similar to how you would interact with the page as a normal user. Also like a normal user, you can only find and perform actions on elements that can be visibly seen via the UI. For a helpful quick start on learning the Capybara Design Specification Language, see the documentation on the [Capybara DSL](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#the-dsl). [This cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/capybara) is also a helpful guide in learning what basic actions you can perform.

### Running System Tests

System tests require extra setup steps in order for you to run them locally. As a result, they are disabled by default. If you wish to run system tests on your machine you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Download [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) on your machine. This is the browser with which we will use to test UI actions.

2. Download [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). This will allow our System Tests to perform actions on the Chrome browser.

3. In a terminal on your machine, run ChromeDriver by typing the command `chromedriver --whitelisted-ips`. The `--whitelisted-ips` flag is used to let ChromeDriver know to allow the connection with a docker terminal.

    > :spiral_notepad: **Note:** On Windows ensure ChromeDriver is run from a Command Prompt or Windows Powershell.

4. In a separate terminal, start a bash shell within the Docker Rails environment by running `docker-compose run -p 3434:3434 --rm rails bash`. Notice that we exposed port 3434 by adding the argument `-p 3434:3434`. Port 3434 is the port with which Capybara will use to serve the test MarkUs instance for Chrome to use.

5. Run system tests by running `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/ rspec spec/system` in the bash shell you created in step 4. Currently, Capybara does not support applications with a different relative url root which is why you must set `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/`. You will also notice that due to the additional setup for system tests, they are ignored by default and must be explicitly defined in order for rspec to run them. Simply running `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/ rspec` will not run the system test suite.

    **Optional**: By default system UI tests are run headless and cannot be viewed using a browser window. While this is generally faster, if you wish to view the tests in a browser window (such as for debugging), you can set and add the environment variable `DISABLE_HEADLESS_UI_TESTING=true` when running system tests.

#### Troubleshooting

- If you see a test failing with the following message near the top:

```bash
Failure/Error: TCPSocket.open(conn_addr, conn_port, @local_host, @local_port)

      Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL:
        Failed to open TCP connection to localhost:9515 (Cannot assign requested address - connect(2) for "localhost" port 9515)
```

This means that Capybara cannot connect to the ChromeDriver running on your machine from the docker container it is running from. Check to ensure you have ran the commands above with the proper arguments. They are all necessary to allow Capybara and Chromedriver to communicate with each other. If you are still having trouble, it may be your running docker containers are configured incorrectly to communicate with Chromedriver. In this case, you may find it helpful to rebuild your docker containers.

### General Tips

#### Code Duplication

Sometimes you will find yourself writing very similar specs for different models or controllers. If you smell such code duplication (e.g., when you are copying and pasting a lot of old spec to create new spec without changing much of the spec code structure), you should probably use [shared examples](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/example-groups/shared-examples). Shared examples give you a way to specify the abstract common behavior of some objects (a model or a controller in most cases) in a single place, and apply the behavior to multiple specs of concrete objects. Shared examples that logically belong to the same group are given a name appropriate for the concrete objects they are describing. Usually, the name would be a noun starting with an article (e.g., `a duck`, `an apple`), but that might not always be the case. Think of the use case of your shared examples -- how does it read when you say `it_behaves_like 'your_shared_examples_name'` (or any other alias of `it_behaves_like`)?

Shared examples are usually placed in its own file under `spec/support`, unless they are only shared by specs in one file, in which case they can placed within the same file. Name the file using the shared examples name without the article (e.g., `duck.rb`, `apple.rb`). Don't append `_spec` in the filename of shared examples, as that causes RSpec to double load the file (first by RSpec itself and later by `spec_helper.rb`) and generate warnings.

```ruby
# spec/support/duck.rb

shared_examples 'a duck' do
  # You can write RSpec code like normal in a `shared_examples` block.

  describe '#swim' do
    # ...
  end

  describe '#quack' do
    # ...
  end
end

# spec/model/swan.rb

describe Swan do
  it_behaves_like_a 'duck'
end

# spec/model/goose.rb

describe Goose do
  it_behaves_like_a 'duck'
end

```

In Markus, one use case of shared examples is [`a criterion`](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/blob/master/spec/support/criterion.rb), which specifies the common behavior of `RubricCriterion` and a `FlexibleCriterion`.

You can also use an alias for the method `it_behaves_like_a` to make the spec code read better. For example, `it_has_behavior 'enumerability'`. The aliases should be defined in [spec/support/it_behaves_like_aliases.rb](https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Markus/blob/master/spec/support/it_behaves_like_aliases.rb).

## Testing with Jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a JavaScript testing framework focused on simplicity. It works well with multiple popular frameworks, such as Node, Angular, Vue, and of course React. It provides a test runner and several handy functions; however, to fully use its capability, Jest is often combined with some other testing libraries. As of now, both [React Testing Library (RTL)](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) are being used alongside Jest in Markus.

On a high level, RTL allows you to test from the user's perspective, while Enzyme gives you access to the internal states/implementation of the components.

Similar to RSpec, Jest also involves specifications. It is recommended that you follow along the `__tests__` folder, under `app/assets/javascripts/Components/`, for this tutorial.

### How to Run Jest Specifications

**Note:** The following commands assume you are within the Markus root folder. If you running MarkUs with Docker, you must be in a shell in the [rails Docker container](Developer-Guide--Set-Up-With-Docker.md#running-commands-in-docker).

`npm` is the package manager we use in Markus.

To run all specifications:

```sh
npm run test
```

To run all specifications with the test-coverage table shown:

```sh
npm run test-cov
```

To run a specific specification:

```sh
npm run test <filename>
```

For example, to run the `StudentTable` specification, run `npm run test student_table.test.jsx`.

These commands are specified in `package.json`, under Markus root.

### Jest Configurations

There are a lot of [configurations](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration) within Jest. The main source of configuration is jest.config.js under the Markus root. Most of the settings are left as default, and each setting has a comment explaining what they are for. Make sure you update the respective settings when needed. We'll cover 3 important ones below.

#### setupFiles

This setting points to a list of files that are run to set up the testing environment. For instance, the imports of `JQuery` and `I18n` would be in it.

#### setupFilesAfterEnv

This setting points to a list of files that are run immediately after the setup of testing environment, before the actual tests. This is a great place for your global imports in the test files, such as the import of `React`, the configuration of `Enzyme`.

#### testMatch

This setting points to a list of patterns that entails directories/modules you want Jest to look at to find your tests. For instance, `**/__tests__/**/*.[jt]s?(x)` would include the path `app/assets/javascripts/Components/__tests__/student_table.test.jsx`.

### Jest Naming Conventions

#### Folders

Currently we use a centralized `__tests__` folder under `components`. The folder is intended to include tests for all the React components.

#### Files

The name of the file should have the format `<component>.test.jsx`. For instance, the test file for the StudentTable component would be `student_table.test.jsx`.

It is also recommended to make sure a file focuses on testing one specific component. If a component makes use of other child components with sufficient complexity, you could make a test file for each of those child components in addition to the parent component.

### Example tests

From `student_table.test.jsx`:

#### React Testing Library

```js
describe("For the StudentTable component's rendering", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    render(<StudentTable ... />);
  });

  describe("the parent component", () => {
    ...
    it("renders a child StudentsActionBox", () => {
      expect(within(screen.getByTestId("raw_student_table")).getByTestId("student_action_box"))
        .toBeInTheDocument;
    });
    ...
```

This code snippet illustrates a commonly used Jest structure alongside several RTL methods.

The `describe` block is a global in Jest used to group tests together. In general we aim to make sure the test cases read like complete sentences (i.e. For the StudentTable component's rendering the parent component renders a child StudentsActionBox).

The `beforeEach` block is a global in Jest that is executed before every example. Similarly, the `beforeAll` block is a global in Jest that is executed before all examples. If a `beforeEach` or `beforeAll` is inside a `describe` block, it runs at the beginning of the `describe` block.

Individual test cases are written with an `it` block, which consists of a description of the test case followed by the code as a callback - notice its structure is essentially the same as a `describe` block.

`getByTestId("...")` is a method used to find an element using its `data-testid` attribute. In React we can declare such attribute in the form of

```js
<ElementName ... data-testid={"some string"}/>
```

`render` is RTL's render method, which renders an element into a container (i.e. attaching to `document.body`). After calling this method we can use `screen.<query_method>` (such as `screen.getByTestId`) to locate elements. Reference the [testing library API and documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/) for a complete list of queries.

`toBeInTheDocument` is a matcher utility provided by [Jest-DOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom). This matcher allows you to assert whether an element is present in the document or not.

Again, this is only a snippet. The libraries and Jest have much more to show.

#### Enzyme

```js
describe("each filterable column has a custom filter method", () => {
    let wrapper, filter_method;
    beforeAll(() => {
      wrapper = mount(<StudentTable ... />);
    });

    describe("the filter method for the section column", () => {
      beforeAll(() => {
        filter_method =
          wrapper.instance().wrapped.checkboxTable.wrappedInstance.props.columns[6].filterMethod;
      });

      it("returns true when the selected value is all", () => {
        expect(filter_method({value: "all"})).toEqual(true);
      });
    ...
```

The overall structure is practically the same as the RTL snippet. The differences lie within the implementation of the test cases.

Recall the Enzyme allows you access to the internal states of a component/element.

`mount` is a render method of Enzyme that deep renders a component. Its counterpart `shallow` shallow renders a component. On a high level, the former renders a component's children while the latter does not.

`wrapper.instance()` gives you this returned React component, from which you can dig deeper to find specific internal states to test/modify.

#### Mocking

While writing tests you might find [mocking](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions) useful. It allows you to manipulate the mocked function's calls' return value.

Consider the following code for the StudentTable component from `student_table.jsx` (it wraps around the RawStudentTable component so we look at this component's code):

```js
class RawStudentTable extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    ...
    this.state = {
      data: {
        students: [],
        sections: {},
        counts: {all: 0, active: 0, inactive: 0},
      },
      ...
    };
  }

  ...

  fetchData = () => {
      $.ajax({
        method: "get",
        url: ...,
        ...
      }).then(res => {
        this.setState({
          data: res,
          ...
        });
      });
    };
```

It would be useful to mock this fetchData function so that we can test whether the component behaves as we expect it to under different scenarios:

```js
describe("For the StudentTable's display of students", () => {
  let wrapper, students_sample;

  describe("when some students are fetched", () => {
    ...

    beforeAll(() => {
      students_sample = [...];
      // Mocking the response returned by $.ajax, used in StudentTable fetchData
      $.ajax = jest.fn(() =>
        Promise.resolve({
          students: students_sample,
          sections: {1: "LEC0101"},
          counts: {all: 2, active: 2, inactive: 0},
        })
      );
      wrapper = mount(<StudentTable ... />);
    });
    ...
  });

  ...

  describe("when no students are fetched", () => {
    beforeAll(() => {
      students_sample = [];
      // Mocking the response returned by $.ajax, used in StudentTable fetchData
      $.ajax = jest.fn(() =>
        Promise.resolve({
          students: students_sample,
          sections: {},
          counts: {all: 0, active: 0, inactive: 0},
        })
      );
      wrapper = mount(<StudentTable ... />);
    });
```

Here we're mocking the `$.ajax` function so that instead of its own implementation, in this test whenever it's called, it would return what we told it to. We know the function should return a promise consisting of some data that can be used to fill in the component's `data` state by reading through `fetchData`'s own implementation. In addition, we can use the react developer tools (explained below in the [Tips](#tips) section) to examine the component's props and states too.

In this case, we want to test how the component behaves when some students are fetched vs no students are fetched, and we easily achieve this through mocking the return value of the `$.ajax` function.

**Note:** in situations like this, reading through the documentation for the specific function(s) could be helpful as well.

### Tips

1. Consider installing the [React Developer Tools (linked to the chrome extension)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) extension. If you aren't using chrome, there should be an equivalence for your browser. It allows you to select and view a component's rendering tree and states/props, and is useful in many situations, such as learning the behavior of a component, debugging, etc.
2. Make use of Jest's [globals](https://jestjs.io/docs/api) to counter code duplication.
