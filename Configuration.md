# Configuration Settings

*new in version 1.12.0*: Custom configuration settings for MarkUs can be set by adding a `config/settings.local.yml` file.
Values in this file are described below and will override any default values in the `config/settings.yml` or the environment specific files in `config/settings`.

## Default Values

To show the default values for your environment, run the following command in the root directory of the installed MarkUs instance:

```sh
echo 'puts JSON.parse(Settings.to_json).to_yaml' | NO_SCHEMA_VALIDATE=1 NO_INIT_SCHEDULER=1 bundle exec rails console
```

By specifying `NO_SCHEMA_VALIDATE` an error will not be raised if a required key is missing.
By specifying `NO_INIT_SCHEDULER` an error will not be raised if MarkUs can't connect to a redis instance (not required for this task).

## Settings

### Rails Specific Settings

All values under the `rails:` key are used to set the `Rails.configuration` object when the app starts.

For example, the `queue_adapter` option sets `Rails.configuration.queue_adapter`, and `asset_host` sets `Rails.configuration.action_mailer.asset_host`. For full details see [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html)

The default values for these should be good enough for most applications.

```

## Additional queue names

By default, background jobs will be run using the queue specified by the

```yaml
queue:
  default:
```

setting. If you would like to use different queue names for different background jobs, you can specify additional keys (the background job name written in snake case) under the `queue:` key.

For example, the following conifguration:

```yaml
queue:
  default: default
  autotest_specs_job: specs_queue
  split_pdf_job: some_other_one
```

Will run all background jobs using a queue named "default" except for `AutotestSpectsJob` which will use a queue named "specs_queue" and `SplitPdfJob` which will use a queue named "some_other_one".

## Scheduled background jobs

MarkUs uses the [resque-scheduler gem](https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler) to schedule background jobs. The configuration is nested under the settings key `resque_scheduler`, and can be omitted entirely.

We recommend scheduling the `CleanTmpJob` to regularly clean the MarkUs `tmp/` folder. Here is a sample configuration:

```yaml
resque_scheduler:
  CleanTmpJob:
    class: ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::ResqueAdapter::JobWrapper
    queue: DEFAULT_QUEUE
    every: 2d  # run every two days
    # never: "* * * * * *"  # replace every: with never: if you want to run the job manually
    args:
      job_class:  CleanTmpJob
      arguments:
        - 5184000  # 60 days, in seconds; see CleanTmpJob documentation for details
```

## Student Tests

Students are only allowed to run one test at a time. This means that a student must wait until the results from a previous test have returned before they can run another one. If a test result never returns (because of an unexpected error) a student will instead have to wait `student_test_buffer_minutes` before they can run a new test.

## User Authentication Options

When a user logs in to MarkUs they can be authenticated in one of two ways:

1. Local authentication: their username, password, and (optionally) their IP address are sent to the stdin pipe of a script file on disk. If that script exits with a 0, the user is authenticated.
2. Remote authentication: some other service (such as a Single Sign-on provider) authenticates the user's user name and password for MarkUs. If the user is authenticated by this service, the user's user name should be sent in the request header as the value of the "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_USER" key (see Installation instructions for more details).

Once a user is authenticated, using one of the two methods above, MarkUs will check if there is a user with the given user name in the database. If so, the user will be logged in.

MarkUs can be set up to use only one of the authentication options or both depending on which settings are enabled:

**To enable local authentication, set the following settings:**

- `validate_file:` an absolute path to a script that expects input from stdin (user name, password, and IP address; separated by "\n") and returns 0 if the user is authenticated and any other positive integer otherwise.
- `validate_ip:` a boolean value indicating whether MarkUs should send the IP address of the current user to stdin of the validate_file script. If false, only the user name and password will be sent.
- `validate_user_not_allowed_message:` a message to display to users when the validate_file script returns 0 (they are authenticated) but there is no user with the given user name in the MarkUs database. If this is not set, a generic "Login failed" message will be shown.
- `local_auth_login_name:` when a user visits the login page, they will see a button that says "Login with MarkUs authentication". This variable customizes this message. For example the button will read "Login with My super secret method" if the setting is:

```yaml
local_auth_login_name: My super secret method
```

- `validate_custom_status_message:` a hash containing exit statuses (integers) as keys and user facing messages (strings) as values. This allows you to choose what message is displayed to your users depending on the exit status returned by the validate_file script. For example, lets say your validate_file script checks if a user name contains whitespace characters and warns the user if so, you could have the following in your settings:

```yaml
validate_custom_status_message:
  "7": "User names cannot contain whitespace"
```

**To enable remote authentication, set the following settings:**

- `remote_auth_login_url:` The url of a remote authentication service. MarkUs will redirect the user to this URL when logging in and the service should redirect the user back on a successful login (depending on the behaviour of the specific service).
- `remote_auth_login_name:` when a user visits the login page, they will see a button that says "Login with remote authentication". This variable customizes this message. For example the button will read "Login with shibboleth" if the setting is:

```yaml
local_auth_login_name: shibboleth
```

### Logout redirect

The `logout_redirect` setting determines where the user will be redirected when they logout of MarkUs. It can be one of `DEFAULT`, `NONE`, or a URL.

- `DEFAULT`: the user will be redirected to MarkUs' login page
- `NONE`: MarkUs will render a 404 error page
- URL: MarkUs will redirect the user to this URL

## Environment variables

All of the settings described above can also be set using environment variables. Environment variables start with `MARKUS__` followed by each nested yaml key separated by `__`. For example,

```sh
MARKUS__REDIS__URL=redis://localhost:6379/1
```

is equivalent to setting this in a yml file:

```yaml
redis:
  url: 'redis://localhost:6379/1'
```

Any setting set by an environment variable will override a setting set in a yml file.

One setting option can only be changed by an environment variable. To set the relative url root for your MarkUs instance, you must set the `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` environment variable. For example, if your relative url root is `/csc108` then you can start the rails server as:

```sh
RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/csc108 bundle exec rails server
```

## Error Notification Emails

If you wish to be informed when a user encounters a server error whilst using MarkUs, you can configure MarkUs to send you an email whenever such an error event happens along with its details. To do so, under the `exception_notification` settings, set the `enabled` setting to true. Be sure to then specify a `sender` email address and a list of `recipients` addresses. You can also optionally set a `sender_display_name` and an `email_prefix`.

Note that in order for this feature to work, you **must** have ActionMailer [configured](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html) to send emails. This means that you must select an ActionMailer `delivery_method` with the appropriate settings and you must also set `perform_deliveries` to true. You will be unable to send or recieve error notification emails otherwise.

This feature informs you of all uncaught exceptions that occur in the MarkUs backend. In order to possibly avoid filling recipient inboxes with a lot of the same error notifications, email notifications are sent after every `2**n` occurences of the same error. For more details, visit the [exception notification](https://github.com/smartinez87/exception_notification) gem homepage with which we use to provide you this feature.
